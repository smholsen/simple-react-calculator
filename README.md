# React Calculator
This is a simple calculator built using React. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Getting Started
To get started, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-calculator.git
cd react-calculator
npm install
```

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can start the development server by running:

`npm start`

This will start the development server and open the calculator in your default web browser.

# How to Use
Using the calculator is simple. Just click the buttons to enter numbers and operators, and click the "=" button to perform the calculation. You can use the "Clear" button to clear the input and output fields.
